# whatever2vec ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

By @christabella, @NightmareNyx and @smspillaz

We present a comprehensive comparison of word vector generation models using the skip-gram algorithm, the continuous bag of words algorithm (Mikolov et al.), the AWD-LSTM model (Merity et al.) and Node2Vec over a graph of words (Grover et al.). We also compare word senses using the approach given in Arora et al.

The results of our experiments can be found in the [https://github.com/smspillaz/whatever2vec/tree/master/results](results) directory.
